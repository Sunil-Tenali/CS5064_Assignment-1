## Overview
This project is a 3D cubic grid simulator that allows users to interact with a structured grid by moving, coloring, and filling a solid cube within a defined 3D space. The cubic grid consists of equispaced parallel lines along the X, Y, and Z axes, forming a 5×5×5 or 10×10×10 cubic structure. The solid cube can be moved, rotated, and colored within this grid while ensuring alignment with the grid lines.

## Features

3D Cubic Grid: A structured 3D grid created using parallel lines along the x, y, and z axes.

### 1. Solid Cube Interaction:

Move the cube within the grid using six control keys.

Prevents movement beyond the grid boundaries.

### 2.  Coloring & Filling:

Change the solid cube’s color by entering RGB values via a prompt.

Permanently fill grid positions with the solid cube’s current color.

Clear colored positions if needed.

### 3. 3D Grid Rotation:

Rotate the entire cubic grid, including all colored portions, in four directions.

The solid cube retains its position relative to the grid while rotating.
